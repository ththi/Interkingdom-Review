Steps for getting the trees (for fungi and bacteria separate):


1. make (sorted) lists of most abundant OTUs for each dataset (e.g. Sugarcane Roots), together with taxonomic information.

2. gather all taxa (either Genus or Family) that appear once above 1% RA

3. retrieve refererence sequences for those taxa from public databases. Most are from  SILVA database (bacteria, SILVA 132, SSU Ref Nr99) or UNITE (fungi, general release 10.10.2017). Reference Sequences are collected solely on taxonomic assignment !

4. those reference sequences have been used for the tree reconstruction

5. add RA information for each taxa / dataset combination from list (see step 1)
